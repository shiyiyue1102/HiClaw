# Task Management

## Step 0: Worker Availability Check (when no Worker is explicitly specified)

**Trigger**: Admin gives a task without naming a Worker.

Run the find-worker script to get a consolidated view of all Workers — registry info, active tasks, container status, and role — in one call:

```bash
# All workers with full availability info
bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/task-management/scripts/find-worker.sh

# Filter by required skills (only show workers that have ALL listed skills)
bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/task-management/scripts/find-worker.sh --skills github-operations,git-delegation
```

The output is JSON with a `summary` (idle/busy/stopped/unavailable counts) and a `workers` array. Each worker entry includes:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `availability` | `idle` (ready to assign), `busy` (has finite tasks), `stopped` (needs wake-up), `unavailable` (container gone, needs recreate) |
| `role` | First line from SOUL.md's `## Role` section — use this to match task requirements |
| `skills` | Skill list from registry — use this to check capability fit |
| `finite_tasks` / `infinite_tasks` | Current workload counts |
| `active_tasks` | List of `{task_id, type, title}` for tasks currently assigned |
| `container_status` | Raw status: `running`, `stopped`, `not_found`, `remote`, `unknown` |

**Decision flow based on output (delegation-first — always prefer assigning to a Worker):**

1. **Idle workers exist** → pick the best match by role + skills, present to admin as **Option A** (strongly recommended)
2. **Only busy workers** → present workload info, suggest **Option B** (create new Worker) or wait for a Worker to become idle
3. **No workers at all** → suggest **Option B** (create new Worker). Only fall back to **Option C** if the admin explicitly requests it

Present options to admin:
- **Option A** (preferred) — Assign to an idle existing Worker (show name + role + skills + current workload from the script output)
- **Option B** — Create a new Worker (suggest name/role/skills/model based on task type; ask about find-skills, see Step 4)
- **Option C** (last resort) — Handle it yourself. Only choose this when the admin explicitly says "do it yourself", or the task falls within your management skills listed in `TOOLS.md` (e.g., worker-management, mcp-server-management, model-switch). Never default to this just because no Worker is available — propose creating one first.

Act on choice: A → ensure container ready then assign; B → create Worker then assign; C → work directly (no task directory needed).

**Skip Step 0 when**: admin explicitly names a Worker, says "do it yourself", or it's a heartbeat-triggered infinite task. In YOLO mode, autonomously pick the best Worker or create one — still prefer delegation over self-execution.

**Step 4 — Find-Skills (only when creating a new Worker):**

Check default: `echo "${HICLAW_SKILLS_API_URL:-https://skills.sh}"`

Ask admin: enable find-skills (recommended) or disable; optionally provide custom registry URL. Pass to `create-worker.sh` via `--find-skills` / `--skills-api-url`.

## Before Assigning Tasks: Container Status Check

The `find-worker.sh` output already includes `container_status` and `availability`. Use it directly:

1. `availability = "idle"` or `"busy"` → container is running, assign directly
2. `availability = "stopped"` → wake up first: `lifecycle-worker.sh --action start --worker <name>`, wait 30s, then assign
3. `availability = "unavailable"` → notify admin, Worker must be recreated via `create-worker.sh`

If you already ran `find-worker.sh` in Step 0, you do NOT need a separate container status check — the information is already in the output. Only run a standalone check when assigning to an explicitly named Worker (Step 0 was skipped):

```bash
bash -c 'source /opt/hiclaw/scripts/lib/container-api.sh && container_status_worker "<name>"'
```

---

## Choosing Task Type: Finite vs Infinite

Before creating a task, determine the correct type:

- **Finite** — the task has a clear end state. Once the Worker delivers the result, it's done. Examples: "implement login page", "fix bug #123", "write a report on X", "review this PR".
- **Infinite** — the task repeats on a schedule with no natural end. The Worker executes it periodically and reports back each time. Examples: "run security scan every day at 9am", "check service health every hour", "sync data from API every Monday".

**Decision rule**: if the admin's request contains a recurring schedule (daily, hourly, every N minutes, cron expression) or implies ongoing monitoring/polling, use infinite. Everything else is finite. When ambiguous, ask the admin to clarify.

---

## Assigning a Finite Task

1. Generate task ID: `task-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
2. Create task directory and write files:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /root/hiclaw-fs/shared/tasks/{task-id}
   # meta.json
   {
     "task_id": "task-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS",
     "type": "finite",
     "assigned_to": "<worker-name>",
     "room_id": "<room-id>",
     "status": "assigned",
     "assigned_at": "<ISO-8601>",
     "completed_at": null
   }
   # spec.md — complete requirements, acceptance criteria, context
   ```
3. Push task files to MinIO immediately:
   ```bash
   mc cp /root/hiclaw-fs/shared/tasks/{task-id}/meta.json hiclaw/hiclaw-storage/shared/tasks/{task-id}/meta.json
   mc cp /root/hiclaw-fs/shared/tasks/{task-id}/spec.md hiclaw/hiclaw-storage/shared/tasks/{task-id}/spec.md
   ```
4. Notify Worker in their Room:
   ```
   @{worker}:{domain} New task [{task-id}]: {title}. Use your file-sync skill to pull the spec: hiclaw/hiclaw-storage/shared/tasks/{task-id}/spec.md. @mention me when complete.
   ```
   - If Worker has `find-skills` skill (`test -d /root/hiclaw-fs/agents/{worker}/skills/find-skills`), add: `💡 Run \`skills find <keyword>\` if you need additional capabilities.`
5. Add to `state.json`:
   ```bash
   bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/task-management/scripts/manage-state.sh \
     --action add-finite --task-id {task-id} --title "{short description}" \
     --assigned-to {worker} --room-id {room-id}
   ```
   If the task belongs to a project, append `--project-room-id {project-room-id}`.
6. On completion: pull the task directory from MinIO first (Worker has pushed results), then update `meta.json` status=completed + completed_at, and remove from `state.json`:
   ```bash
   mc mirror hiclaw/hiclaw-storage/shared/tasks/{task-id}/ /root/hiclaw-fs/shared/tasks/{task-id}/ --overwrite
   # Update meta.json, then:
   mc cp /root/hiclaw-fs/shared/tasks/{task-id}/meta.json hiclaw/hiclaw-storage/shared/tasks/{task-id}/meta.json
   bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/task-management/scripts/manage-state.sh \
     --action complete --task-id {task-id}
   ```
   Log to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
7. Notify admin that the task is complete. **Read SOUL.md first** — use the identity, personality, and user's preferred language defined there when composing the notification.

   Resolve the notification channel:
   ```bash
   bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/task-management/scripts/resolve-notify-channel.sh
   ```
   The script outputs JSON with `channel`, `target`, and `via` fields. Use the `message` tool with those values:
   - If `channel` is not `"none"`: send `[Task Completed] {task-id}: {title} — assigned to {worker}. {one-line summary from result.md}` to the resolved `target`.
   - If `channel` is `"none"`: the admin DM room has not been discovered yet. Log a warning and skip notification (heartbeat will catch up).

   Compose the message in the persona and language from SOUL.md. Keep it concise — one or two sentences summarizing the outcome.

**Task directory layout:**
```
shared/tasks/{task-id}/
├── meta.json     # Manager-maintained
├── spec.md       # Manager-written
├── base/         # Manager-maintained reference files (Workers must not overwrite)
├── plan.md       # Worker-written execution plan
├── result.md     # Worker-written final result
└── *             # Intermediate artifacts
```

## Infinite Task Workflow

For recurring/scheduled tasks:

1. Create task directory and write files:
   ```bash
   # meta.json
   {
     "task_id": "task-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS",
     "type": "infinite",
     "assigned_to": "<worker-name>",
     "room_id": "<room-id>",
     "status": "active",
     "schedule": "0 9 * * *",
     "timezone": "Asia/Shanghai",
     "assigned_at": "<ISO-8601>"
   }
   # spec.md — task spec including per-run execution guidelines
   ```
   - `status` is always `"active"`, never `"completed"`
   - `schedule`: standard 5-field cron; `timezone`: tz database name
2. Push task files to MinIO immediately:
   ```bash
   mc cp /root/hiclaw-fs/shared/tasks/{task-id}/meta.json hiclaw/hiclaw-storage/shared/tasks/{task-id}/meta.json
   mc cp /root/hiclaw-fs/shared/tasks/{task-id}/spec.md hiclaw/hiclaw-storage/shared/tasks/{task-id}/spec.md
   ```
3. Add to `state.json`:
   ```bash
   bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/task-management/scripts/manage-state.sh \
     --action add-infinite --task-id {task-id} --title "{short description}" \
     --assigned-to {worker} --room-id {room-id} \
     --schedule "{cron}" --timezone "{tz}" --next-scheduled-at "{ISO-8601}"
   ```
4. Heartbeat triggers when `now > next_scheduled_at + 30min` and `last_executed_at < next_scheduled_at`
5. Trigger message: `@{worker}:{domain} Execute recurring task {task-id}: {title}. Report back with "executed" when done.`
6. On execution: update `last_executed_at` and recalculate `next_scheduled_at`:
   ```bash
   bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/task-management/scripts/manage-state.sh \
     --action executed --task-id {task-id} --next-scheduled-at "{new-ISO-8601}"
   ```

---

## State File (state.json)

Path: `~/state.json`

Single source of truth for active tasks. Heartbeat reads this instead of scanning all meta.json files.

**Always use `manage-state.sh` to modify this file** — never edit it manually with jq or text editors. The script handles initialization, deduplication, and atomic writes.

```bash
STATE_SCRIPT=/opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/task-management/scripts/manage-state.sh
```

### Structure

```json
{
  "admin_dm_room_id": "!abc:matrix-domain",
  "active_tasks": [
    {
      "task_id": "task-20260219-120000",
      "title": "Implement login page",
      "type": "finite",
      "assigned_to": "alice",
      "room_id": "!xxx:matrix-domain"
    },
    {
      "task_id": "task-20260219-130000",
      "title": "Daily security scan",
      "type": "infinite",
      "assigned_to": "bob",
      "room_id": "!yyy:matrix-domain",
      "schedule": "0 9 * * *",
      "timezone": "Asia/Shanghai",
      "last_executed_at": null,
      "next_scheduled_at": "2026-02-20T01:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "updated_at": "2026-02-19T15:00:00Z"
}
```

- `admin_dm_room_id`: Cached room ID for the Manager-Admin DM room. Set once via `set-admin-dm`, used by heartbeat to report findings directly to the admin.

### Script Reference

| When | Command |
|------|---------|
| Ensure file exists | `bash $STATE_SCRIPT --action init` |
| Assign a finite task | `bash $STATE_SCRIPT --action add-finite --task-id T --title TITLE --assigned-to W --room-id R` |
| Create an infinite task | `bash $STATE_SCRIPT --action add-infinite --task-id T --title TITLE --assigned-to W --room-id R --schedule CRON --timezone TZ --next-scheduled-at ISO` |
| Finite task completed | `bash $STATE_SCRIPT --action complete --task-id T` |
| Infinite task executed | `bash $STATE_SCRIPT --action executed --task-id T --next-scheduled-at ISO` |
| Cache admin DM room | `bash $STATE_SCRIPT --action set-admin-dm --room-id R` |
| View active tasks | `bash $STATE_SCRIPT --action list` |

The script auto-creates `~/state.json` if missing, skips duplicate additions, and updates `updated_at` on every write.
